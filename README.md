# Facial-Landmarks-Detection-ResNet18

n this work, we develop a facial landmarks detection
model using a ResNet18 neural network that has been previously
trained for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. Our
approach involves framing the landmark detection task as a
regression problem and minimizing the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) loss across 194 landmarks. The ResNet18 model serves
as the basis for our facial landmarks detection model, and its
performance on the ImageNet classification task serves as a
starting point for fine-tuning on the landmark detection task.
Our based model achieved a MSE loss of 27.84 on the test set.
